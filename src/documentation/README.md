# What is Mida?
Mida is the TypeScript framework for trading financial assets such as stocks,
crypto, forex or commodities. It is designed from the ground up to provide a solid,
versatile and platform-neutral environment for creating trading bots, indicators,
market analysis tools or just trading applications depending on use cases.

The Mida ecosystem is built from the ground up in TypeScript and some C for
the performance-critical parts. The framework can be used with JavaScript/TypeScript
on Node.js.
