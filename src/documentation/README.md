# Mida
Mida is the TypeScript framework for trading financial assets such as stocks, crypto, forex or commodities.
It is designed to provide a solid, versatile and platform-neutral environment for creating trading bots, indicators,
market analysis tools or just trading applications depending on use cases.

The Mida ecosystem is built from the ground up in TypeScript and C++.
The framework can be used with JavaScript/TypeScript on Node.js and also with
other runtimes like Deno.

## Supported platforms
Mida is broker-neutral, this means any broker could be easily integrated in
the ecosystem, until now all brokers available on the cTrader platform are supported,
below some of the most long-lived and popular ones.
